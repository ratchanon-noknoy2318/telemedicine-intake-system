# Telemedicine Intake System

Backend-driven web platform for automating patient intake and screening in telemedicine services.

The system digitizes patient registration, consent collection, and pre-consultation screening — enabling healthcare staff to access structured patient data before consultations begin.

Used in real municipal telemedicine operations in Thailand.

## Impact

* Reduced manual patient intake workload by **~80%**
* Eliminated paper-based intake process
* Enabled pre-consultation access to structured patient data
* Improved data accuracy and consistency for clinical workflows
* Deployed and used in **real-world municipal healthcare services**

---

## Problem

Telemedicine appointments required healthcare staff to manually collect:

* Patient registration details
* Consent forms
* Preliminary screening information

This resulted in:

* Administrative bottlenecks
* Delays in patient consultations
* Inconsistent and error-prone data collection
* Increased workload for nurses and staff

---

## Solution

Designed and built a web-based intake system to digitize patient onboarding and screening workflows:

* Provided an online intake interface for patients
* Structured and validated input data before submission
* Automated data collection and storage pipeline
* Enabled healthcare staff to review patient data before consultations
* Reduced manual data entry and operational overhead
