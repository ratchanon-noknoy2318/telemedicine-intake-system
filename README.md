## 1. Executive Overview
**KPPMCH** is a robust telemedicine and registration ecosystem designed for **Municipal-Scale healthcare services**. By utilizing a **Serverless Architecture**, the system mitigates hospital congestion and enhances data transmission efficiency between citizens and medical personnel through real-time synchronization across the municipal district.

---

## 2. System Architecture & Design Philosophy

The architecture adheres to **Serverless Principles**, prioritizing horizontal scalability and low operational overhead. By decoupling the ingestion layer from the persistence layer, the system ensures data integrity even during high-concurrency registration spikes.
